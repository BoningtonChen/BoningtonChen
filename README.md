- 👋 Hi, I’m @BoningtonChen
- 👀 I’m interested in C++, Rust and AGIs.
- 🌱 I’m currently using mainly C++ and Rust to do some demos. I'm now involved in the development of Open-Source AGI Tools.
- 🥰 I now have a Theme library of Cherry Studio, welcome to join me and build it with me!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building and discussing AGI Tools, C++ Ray Tracing Demos and Robot Hardware controls.
